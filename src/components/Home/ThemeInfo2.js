            Think of it as a space where conversations run deep and connections are made. Imagine trailblazers from all
            corners of our state, those who are changing the world with their extraordinary projects. TEDxHobart

            The theme for TEDxHobart 2024 is Ripple Effect. What’s that, you ask? It’s just like dropping a pebble into
            a pond and watching the ripples spread far and wide.
          </p>
          <p style={parastyle}>
            Picture this: a single disturbance causing a chain reaction that reverberates through different parts of
            a complex system. It’s not just a concept; the ripple effect can be seen in fields like finance, technology,
            law, agriculture, history, community development, conservation, the arts, and tourism. Imagine how a small
            shift in one area can have a mighty impact across many others.
          </p>
